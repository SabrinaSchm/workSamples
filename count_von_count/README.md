# Count von Count
by Sabrina Schmütsch

## Description
In this interactive Python game, you will be greeted by The Count, a friendly (and slightly dramatic) character who loves numbers. He will challenge you to a fun guessing game where you must guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.

## Usage
### Install Python
1) Download Python from https://www.python.org/.
2) Run the installer.  </br>
Make sure to check the box to have Python added to your PATH if the installer offers such an option. 

### Run Main Program
1) Download the project files from the repository.
2) Open the project folder in Python.
3) Run the script and follow the instructions in the terminal to input your name. </br>
The script will print the sum of the letters in your name.

### Run Unit Tests
1) Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder (if not already there).
2) To run the tests, type:
_python -m unittest test_name_sum.py_
3) The terminal will display the test results. If all tests pass, you’ll see a message saying "OK".
